The application implements two main concepts.

The first is the Redux Toolkit query, with the help of which we create an API and then we can interact with it very conveniently due to the fact that we have various hooks that allow us to automate a huge amount of work and plus it adds additional functionality in the form of caching in the form of very point-to-point interaction with requests and so on, but at the same time there is also classic Redux. Which are now only located in the redux toolkit shell, called slice. It is also quite convenient, because we do not need to describe the state of the object, we simply change the state as we want
